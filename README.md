# Masrur Sabab Khan Chowdhury — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website.

**Live site:** https://masrursababkhanchowdhury.github.io/

This repository contains the files that power my portfolio — a place where I showcase who I am, what I build, and the projects I’m proud of.

## About the Portfolio

My portfolio site is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. It provides:

- A personal introduction and “About Me” section  
- Highlights of my skills and technologies I use  
- Showcases of selected projects and demos  
- Links to my GitHub, social profiles, and contact options

This is a space for me to share both my **professional work** and personal interests.
